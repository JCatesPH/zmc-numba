sigma_multiplication =  100
num_trials =  6
available_GPU = [0]
kxi = - math.pi / a
kxf = math.pi / a
kyi = - math.pi / a
kyf = math.pi / a

========================================================
10 hypercube(s) need(s) to be recalculated, to save time, try drastically increasing sigma_multiplication.
0 hypercube(s) need(s) to be recalculated, to save time, try drastically increasing sigma_multiplication.
0 hypercube(s) need(s) to be recalculated, to save time, try drastically increasing sigma_multiplication.
0 hypercube(s) need(s) to be recalculated, to save time, try drastically increasing sigma_multiplication.
